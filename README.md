## Introduction

I successfully designed and developed a project focused on creating a music application called Lollipop Music using React and Node.js. With a passion for music and technology, I utilized my skills to design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for browsing and playing music. Leveraging React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, I implemented key features such as user authentication, playlist management, and audio playback. This project deepened my knowledge of web development, strengthened my skills in React and Node.js, and demonstrated my ability to create engaging and functional music applications. I'm excited to have contributed to the world of music through technology!

We hope you enjoy the Lollipop Music experience!
